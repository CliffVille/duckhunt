This project was a fun way to sharpen my JavaScript and animation skills by creating a simplified version of the classic Duck Hunt game. The webpage features a dark blue background that sets the mood, a game-themed image as the backdrop, and lively animations of ducks and a dog, complete with a crosshair for interaction. Using CSS keyframes and JavaScript, the ducks react to mouse movements, flying away from the cursor based on calculated positions. Shooting is brought to life with sound effects and animations that make the ducks disappear. The visuals, including resized and polished duck and dog GIFs edited in Photoshop, were carefully chosen to create a simple yet engaging Duck Hunt experience.
